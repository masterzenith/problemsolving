/**
 * Time: O(N); N is the number of characters in the input string
 * Space: The algorithmâ€™s space complexity will be O(K),
 * where K is the number of distinct characters in the input string.
 * This also means K<=N, because in the worst case, the whole string might not have any repeating character,
 * so the entire string will be added to the HashMap. Having said that,
 * since we can expect a fixed set of characters in the input string (e.g., 26 for English letters),
 * we can say that the algorithm runs in fixed space O(1); in this case,
 * we can use a fixed-size array instead of the HashMap.*/
