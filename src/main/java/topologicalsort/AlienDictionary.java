/**
 * Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
 * Output: bac
 * Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
 * from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
 * 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
 * 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
 * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"

/**
 * Time: In step ‘d’, each task can become a source only once and each edge (a rule)
 * will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will
 * be O(V+E), where ‘V’ is the total number of different characters and ‘E’ is the total
 * number of the rules in the alien language. Since, at most, each pair of words can give us one rule,
 * therefore, we can conclude that the upper bound for the rules is O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of
 * words in the input. So, we can say that the time complexity of our algorithm is O(V+N).
 * Space: The space complexity will be O(V+N), since we are storing all of the rules for each
 * character in an adjacency list.
